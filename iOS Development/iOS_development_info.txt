I found out after hours of work that the way that I was trying to create a clickable image, using a UIImageView and then overlaying a touch gesture click event on top of it, was not using smart coding techniques within Xcode 6. Xcode gives you the option of creating a clickable button and then adding a picture to it, so this gives you a clickable picture that you can use the normal Navigation Controller to move through pages.
